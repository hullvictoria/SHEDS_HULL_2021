# SHEDS_HULL_2021
 S.S.C. Trainee Victoria Hull's SHEDS Changes


R file contains all relevant R code and its history. This code was originally obtained from the ICF_DEVEL branch on the SHEDS_DEVEL github repo.

All_Inputs_NotClean contains all input files from the ICF_DEVEL branch and all of the files I have updated over time. I label this is "not clean" because this file contains files that are not compatible with the most recent SHEDS code. 

update_cpdat file contains the weight fraction cleaning script and the code I used to create the new CPDat file.
